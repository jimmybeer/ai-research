# Agents Directory
This folder will hold `.agent.md` definitions that describe Codex personas, responsibilities, and guardrails. Each agent will reference related prompts, workflows, and preferred interfaces so they can be launched quickly from the web, VS Code, or the CLI. Phase 2 will introduce at least four core agents focused on reviews, documentation, testing, and planning.
