# Cheatsheets Directory
Cheatsheets condense complex workflows into quick-reference tables, commands, and checklists. Use them when you need answers fast without rereading entire lessons.

## How to use cheatsheets
- Keep the most relevant cheatsheets open in a split VS Code tab or pinned browser tab.
- Copy commands directly, replacing placeholders in `[brackets]`.
- Pair a cheatsheet with related lessons or workflows for deeper dives.

## Available cheatsheets

2. Follow the format used in existing cheatsheets: header metadata, task sections, examples, troubleshooting.
3. Include real commands/code that have been tested.
4. Update this README table after adding the file.
