# Lessons Directory
Lessons provide focused, step-by-step guides for mastering Codex-assisted workflows (git reviews, requirements management, automation, and more). Future entries will follow a lesson template with objectives, prerequisites, walkthrough steps, and follow-up exercises. Phase 3 will seed the first set of lessons so Codex can tutor future work sessions.
