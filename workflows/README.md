# Workflows Directory
Workflow files demonstrate end-to-end Codex usage patterns, mixing prompts, agents, and scripts to achieve a goal. Each entry should describe triggers, required context, recommended interface (web, VS Code, CLI), and clear steps to reproduce the automation. Phase 3 will populate this folder with sample workflows derived from the patterns in `docs/workflow_patterns.md`.
