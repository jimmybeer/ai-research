# Documentation Prompts
Documentation prompts convert code, notes, or workflows into human-readable guides. They are optimized for completeness and consistent formatting.

## Available prompts
| Prompt | Description | Best Interface |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [`readme_generator.md`](readme_generator.md) | Generates a full README with overview, setup, usage, and contribution sections. | Web / CLI |

## Common use cases
- Spinning up documentation for new repos or internal tools.
- Keeping README files aligned across multiple projects.
- Generating draft release notes or architecture digests before a human edit pass.

When adding new documentation prompts, specify formatting rules, template sections, and links to the relevant agents (e.g., Repository Teacher) for follow-up work.
