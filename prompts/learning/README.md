# Learning Prompts
Learning prompts help you understand new concepts, build study plans, and onboard teammates faster.

## Available prompts
| Prompt | Description | Best Interface |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [`concept_explainer.md`](concept_explainer.md) | Multi-style explanation generator with learning paths and self-checks. | Web / IDE |

## Common use cases
- Clarifying unfamiliar technologies before writing lessons or scripts.
- Creating training snippets for documentation or knowledge sharing.
- Feeding outputs into the Repository Teacher Agent to expand into lessons.

Add new learning prompts when you need specialized teaching styles (e.g., requirements management, architecture deep dives) and document how to adapt them for different audiences.
